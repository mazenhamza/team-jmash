Do you find yourself constantly exchanging money for goods and services?

Are you tired of working for that money?

Well we are - and that's why we're introducing BitBot, the app that makes you money!

What is BitBot?
---------------

BitBot is a simple online interface for manual and automatic Bitcoin trading.  It incorporates a cryptocurrency value prediction algorithm to assist the user in making informed trading decisions.  Users will be able to seamlessly enter the emerging Bitcoin market, and exploit the power of high-speed computing to improve the performance of their investments.  On top of allowing you to auto-trade, BitBot will also have a simple and easy interface for manual trading of Bitcoin.  Users can see market statistics, choose which exchange to buy from and keep track of their investments all in one place.  Finally, the intent of BitBot is to make Bitcoin trading easy for those that are interested in learning it.  Because of this, we also plan to have step-by-step tutorials showing users how to get started.  This includes getting a Bitcoin wallet, how to use Bitcoins and more.
